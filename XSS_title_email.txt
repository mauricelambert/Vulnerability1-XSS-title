[Vulnerability] simpletouchsoftware boxingtimerpro

Hello,

i am contacting you because i found a vulnerability in your Boxing Timer Pro.

I am a developer and security researcher, I use your application regularly and yesterday I found a vulnerability in your application. The vulnerability is Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) reflected in the page title. This vulnerability is very easy to exploit (example (open this URL in your web browser): https://www.simpletouchsoftware.com/timers/boxingtimerpro/?name=</title><script>alert("Demontration: XSS Reflected... You are hacked !")</script>&rounds=45&prep=56&round=2&warning=25&rest=89).

What about the severity of the vulnerability:

1. CRITICAL: If you have an admin page on simpletouchsoftware.com, a hacker can steal your session and use the admin features and permissions on your server.
2. HIGHT: If you have an authentication system on simpletouchsoftware.com, a hacker can steal a user session and spoof their account.
3. MEDIUM: [no conditions] a hacker can use your website to control your users' web browser. It can exploit a Cross-Site-Request-Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability on another website or implement a redirect on a phishing URL from your web application (and your users will see your application as an un trusted or malicious website).

Best regards,
Maurice LAMBERT.
